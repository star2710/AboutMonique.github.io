		<h2 style = "color:Purple"> <center>My Strengths</center> </h2>
		<p style = "color:blue"> Some strengths that I have developed within my 19 years of living is Ambitious, Independent, Trustworthy, Resposible and Open minded. 
		Growing up I was not the person to obtain many strengths but as I grow and become more mature i have developed some strengths that I think play a major role in my everyday life.
	`	</p>
		<p style = "color:blue" >
			Being open minded has played a big role into who I am today. Growing up I was not the person that will go out and try new things. 
			I was a person that stuck to the same thing everyday, with what i eat, what i wear and even places I visit.
			The past four years of my life I have stepped out of my comfort zone and started to try new things and I can say that was the best decsison I ever made.
			I was very happy to experience new things and make new memorys.
		</p>
		<p style = "color:blue">
			Growing up in a sigle parent household i watched how my mother workrd har to raise me. This has caused me to become independent.
			Just by watching her and seeing the things that she did on her own motivated me to become an independent person. 
			Now i can finally say over the past 3 years i have grown independent enough to support myself and also support my mother when needed.
		</p>
		<p style = "color:blue">
			Lastly, I can say that over the last few years I have become a very responsible person. I have not only become more respnsible with time management but I have also become responsible with money management.
			During the recent pandemic which caused alot of persons to become laid off it has taught me to become more responsible with my spending and 
			it also taught me the responsiblities of life.

		<h2 style = "color:Purple"> <center>My Assessment on the book Twelve Pillars</center> </h2>
		<p style = "color:blue">
			Based on the book Twelve Pillars I find that there is a lot of things that I can apply to my life. 
			When Charlie told Michael to write down his goals that is something that I personally think is a great way to achieve goals in life. 
			Writing down your goals as stated brings it to reality. 
			With this system I believe that when you write down your goals you are set on achieving them especially if there is a reward in the end. 
		</p>
		<p style = "color:blue">
			Time management was also a topic mentioned in the book. 
			Charlie stated that persons spend time on what is urgent rather that what is important. 
			I can say that this is a fact because I mostly spend my time on urgent matters but based off what 
			I have read I can now say that time management is a very important thing that I will be working on in my life. 
		</p>
		<p style = "color:blue">
			Charlie mentioned surrounding yourself with the best. 
			I have to agree with the fact that surrounding yourself with the best set of people is a great way to be successful in life. 
			If persons are surrounding by persons that are not productive and constantly doubting themselves and others then there is no room for success there. 
			Surrounding myself with the best a practice that I try to apply in my everyday life. 
		</p>
		<p style = "color:blue">
			Lastly, Charlie mentioned that a successful person is always a life-long learner. 
			As a person going into a world where technology is always evolving I canâ€™t go into that world thinking I know everything. 
			There will be many things to learn along the way and that is why when Charlie said a successful person is always a life-long learner I understood that.
