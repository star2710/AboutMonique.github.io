			<p style = "color:blue"> Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work. I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. 
			At the end of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually it’ll pay off. It could be in a year, it could be in 30 years. 
			Eventually, your hard work will pay off. —<mark> Kevin Hart </mark>

			<p>
				 Based on the personality test that was done, I would have to agree with the results. Based on my results I can say that this test is valid.
				 The test shows that I am 45% introverted and 46% antisocial wihich is true seeing as I am not a very friendly or outgoing person.
				 It also states that I am 88% easygoing and preoccupied with relaxation which is very accurate as I am a person that does not make certain things cause stress in my life.
